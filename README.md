# Power_Supply_30V_10A
30 V, 10 A linear power supply with LM723
Dot ask me for schematic. I didn't use any schematic for this small project.

I've used 2n3055 and D2499 for current amplification. However, you can use any NPN transistor with high Ic and,  hfe around 20-40. 

I've also used UTC-D313 for driving the current amplification stage. but any other typical NPN BJTs (2sc5249, KSC5039F, etc...) must work.

WARNING:

1-  DO NOT FORGET to add a heat sink for current amplification transistors. I don't bear any responsibility for burning out your valuable 2n3055! ;-p

2- Use high power resistors for R2 and R3 (more than 5W).
